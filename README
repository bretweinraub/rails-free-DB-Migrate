Want to run active record migrations without Rails?

We'll me too Daddy, meeee too.

You are in the right place.  This project creates a stub.  

I suggest you use RVM.

Here's what's in my rvm gems dir:

  drwxrwsr-x  3 bweinraub rvm 4096 Apr 21 06:52 activemodel-3.0.7
  drwxrwsr-x  4 bweinraub rvm 4096 Apr 21 06:52 activerecord-3.0.7
  drwxrwsr-x  3 bweinraub rvm 4096 Apr 21 06:52 activesupport-3.0.7
  drwxrwsr-x  4 bweinraub rvm 4096 Apr 21 06:52 arel-2.0.9
  drwxrwsr-x  6 bweinraub rvm 4096 Apr 21 06:52 builder-2.1.2
  drwxrwsr-x  5 bweinraub rvm 4096 Apr 21 06:52 i18n-0.5.0
  drwxrwsr-x  6 bweinraub rvm 4096 Apr 21 12:03 log4r-1.1.9
  drwxrwsr-x  6 bweinraub rvm 4096 Apr 21 12:09 pg-0.11.0
  drwxrwsr-x  4 bweinraub rvm 4096 Apr 21 06:52 tzinfo-0.3.26

Which basically means I install

activerecord
log4r
pg

to get this working.

Use RVM!
